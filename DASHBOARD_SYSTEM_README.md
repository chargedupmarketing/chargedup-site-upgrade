   - Ensure correct service selection
   - Verify user exists in mock data
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Layout Problems**:
   - Verify Tailwind CSS is loaded
   - Check for CSS conflicts

console.log('User:', user);
console.log('Available Tools:', availableTools);
console.log('Tools by Category:', toolsByCategory);
```
