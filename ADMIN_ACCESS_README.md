### 1. Direct URL

- **Admin Panel**: `/admin/newsletter` (after authentication)

### 2. Header Navigation
- **Desktop**: Look for the shield icon (üîê) in the top-right header
- **Mobile**: Open mobile menu and look for "üîê Admin Panel" button

### 3. Footer (Hidden)
- Scroll to the bottom of any page
- Look for the small gear icon (‚öôÔ∏è) in the footer
